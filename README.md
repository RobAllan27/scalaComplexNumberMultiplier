# Scala Complex Number Multiplier
Hi there -  this is another version of Rob's challenge project -  the good old complex number multiplier.
Take in 2 arrays of complex numbers, multiply them and then return back the multiplied array to a file.

## Installation

Install scala
Check scala is installed - scala -version
git clone to your location
There are a couple of demo files that are installed for the input file
Results wil get written to a file called 'outputComplexNumbersSource' - this is not in the repo but will get created.

I happen to use vscode - but obviously pick an IDE for you.

## Usage

To compile
scalac .\ComplexNumberMatrixMultiplierProgram.scala

To run
scala .\ComplexNumberMatrixMultiplierProgram.scala
